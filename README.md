# The Effect of Cancel Culture on Sentiment Over Time

This project analyzes the change in public sentiment towards musicians
who were cancelled or called out on Twitter due to socially unacceptable behavior.
At this current state of the project, our code will generate visualizations that
show how sentiment changes over time for cancelled individuals 6 months before
and after getting cancelled. To measure sentiment, we utilized three APIs: 
[Google Perspective](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/), [Vader](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment),
and [Textblob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/api_reference.html).

## Running the Project
